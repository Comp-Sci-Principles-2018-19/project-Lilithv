**Welcome to the ReadMe of Murder Mystery**

--
The project/game is to promote curiosity and problem solving in the people who don't
fully know how to do so. The characters are meant to be personally challenging through
dialoge and coded personality. It also requires people to look past personality and 
to see a situation at face value without prejudice.

The modules used is Adventurelib, Pandas, NumPy, and pyreadline.
- Adventurelib is used to create rooms and items within the rooms to add an atmosphere
	and organization that normally Python cannot offer.
- Pandas and NumPy is used in tangent of one another to gather data and input/print
	data for the player/console
- pyreadline is for some errors that one of the modules kept throwing up which we found
	out had to be used with this module.

**Intructions**

The mechanics to the game were imported from Adventurelib, based on input from the user on
where to move your character. The inputs are predetermined as "north", "south", "east", and
"west". The inputs aren't case sensitive so there's no need to stress about it, though the
code cannot read any other input.

**Notes from the Programmer**

I had tried to create dialogue through a CSV table to exercise use of Pandas though I was
pretty afraid to use it, due to it felt intimidating and very convoluted from my stand point.
Otherwise, I have everything set up for item gathering and inspection for rooms and items.
