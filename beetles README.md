# Project Name:
Ground Beeeeetles

## Problem
There arent enough ground beetles in people's gardens which in turn pests eat up the plants that are trying to be grown.

## Big Fat Idea
capture the ground beetles in a pit fall trap in a garden that has plenty to spare. take them into a controlled enviroment and breed them with optimal tempurature levels. take weeds out of the garden to feed the grubs b/c grubs feed on roots

## First Agile Iteration
write an input function to input how much you got from the pit fall trap and what sexes were obtained. make the function return how many eggs they will produce. make an input function to how many eggs you got to see how many will survive as grubs. make another function that uses the number of grubs you have ans translates it to how many kilograms of roots you need to feed them. make another input function to how many snails/aphids/caterpillars ect each beetle will eat.
